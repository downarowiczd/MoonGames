# MoonGames 2.0 Archive
This one of my early Minecraft projects. Together with a few guys from Germany we created a mini game for the **game-netz.de** called **MoonGames**.
Many aspects of the games based on the **SurvivalGames** and **EnderGames** (from GommeHD). 
This repository is the main repo for the main plugin of the server. We modified the gravity in random time schedules during the game 😆
The server went offline in January **2016** ⏲️

Thank you all who were part of that project 🥲 It was a great time
